### Project Objective

![ViewCount](https://views.whatilearened.today/views/github/BuzilovDorin/Data-Science-Portfolio.svg?cache=remove)

#### The commercial space age is here, companies are making space travel affordable for everyone. Perhaps the most successful is SpaceX. SpaceXâ€™s accomplishments include: Sending spacecraft to the International Space Station. Starlink, a satellite internet constellation providing satellite Internet access. Sending manned missions to Space. One reason SpaceX can do this is the rocket launches are relatively inexpensive. SpaceX advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website with a cost of 62 million dollars; other providers cost upwards of 165 million dollars each, much of the savings is because SpaceX can reuse the first stage. Therefore, if we can determine if the first stage will land, we can determine the cost of a launch. This information can be used if an alternate company wants to bid against SpaceX for a rocket launch.

#### In this capstone, I will take the role of a data scientist working for a new rocket company. Space Y founded by Billionaire industrialist Allon Musk, that would like to compete with SpaceX. My job is to determine the price of each launch. I will do this by gathering information about Space X and creating dashboards for my team. I will also determine if SpaceX will reuse the first stage. Instead of using rocket science to determine if the first stage will land successfully, I will train a machine learning model and use public information to predict if SpaceX will reuse the first stage.
